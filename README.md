# File Organizer CLI Tool

## Problem Statement
My Downloads folder often becomes cluttered with files of different types,
making it difficult to find important documents. This tool helps organize
files automatically into folders based on their file type.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Save the file as `file_organizer.py`
3. Open terminal and navigate to the file location
4. Now run the file
5. Enter the directory path when prompted

## Sample Output

### Program Execution in Terminal

## Design Decisions
- Used Python for simplicity and portability
- Used standard libraries only (`os`, `shutil`)
- Folder-based categorization improves clarity
- Kept the logic simple and easy to extend
